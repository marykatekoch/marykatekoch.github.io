## Overview
I  research how major developmental transitions like puberty affect health outcomes and identity development.
A central aim of my research is to better understand why some individuals navigate transitions that everyone goes through in their lives more adaptively than others.
I use a variety of methods in my research, including surveys, interviewing, diaries, computational text analysis, content coding, and structural equation modeling.
