I am interested in how individuals navigate difficult life transitions. I approach this research program from a lifespan perspective, and with a diverse set of quantitative and qualitative methodologies. 

Currently, I am a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Florida. I am working on an NIH grant to understand the ways in which people narrate their life stories and interact with their providers may impact health outcomes at the end of life. 

During my PhD Training at Cornell University, I researched how youth make sense of the physical and social changes brought on by puberty to better understand why pubertal change is associated with such a rise in distress during the adolescent transition. 

I have methodological expertise in structural equation modeling, content analysis, and computational text analysis. See my [publications page](publications.html) for examples of my work.
