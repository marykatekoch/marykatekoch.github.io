A central aim of my research is to better\n            understand why some individuals navigate transitions that\n            everyone goes through in their lives more adaptively than\n            others. I use a variety of methods in my research, including\n            surveys, interviewing, diaries, computational text analysis,\n            content coding, and structural equation modeling.\n            In my current position, I am working with Drs.

I hope to translate the methods I have acquired\n            in my postdoc to research that improves parent-child\n            communication in conversations about puberty and,\n            subsequently, mental health outcomes for youth.\n            During my PhD research with Dr. Jane Mendle, much of my work\n            focused on understanding how girls make meaning out of\n            change during puberty and which aspects of puberty are most\n            distressing through a blend of content coding, topic\n            modeling, and structural equation modeling.\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            Research Interests\n            Developmental Transitions\n            Adolescent Development\n            Narrative Identity\n            Psychology of Puberty\n            Computational Text Analysis\n            \n            \n            Education\n            \n            PhD in\n            Developmental Psychology, 2022 Cornell University\n            \n            \n            MA in\n            Developmental Psychology, 2018 Cornell University\n            \n            \n            BA in Psychology\n            & History, 2015 Gonzaga University\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n              Mary Kate Koch PhD\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                                    \n                    \n                       Email\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                       Twitter\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                       GitHub\n                    \n                  \n                                    \n                    \n                       LinkedIn\n                    \n                  \n                                  \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              Postdoctoral Research Fellow\n              \n              University of Florida\n              \n              My main interests are how major developmental\n              transitions like puberty affect health outcomes and\n              identity development.
