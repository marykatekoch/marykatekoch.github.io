In particular, my research has\n            focused on how youth experience puberty and the messages\n            society sends youth about gender and identity during this\n            time. More recently, my research has focused on how social\n            responsibilities affect the ways in which older adults with\n            life-threatening illness prepare loved ones for their\n            potential death. While puberty and dying may seem quite\n            different, both are major life transitions through which\n            everyone must pass. Accordingly, these transitions are\n            useful for highlighting individual differences and societal\n            impacts. In researching these transitions, I am guided by\n            the overarching question of why these transitions seem\n            easier for some individuals than others.\n            I use a person-centered approach to my research that\n            incorporates individuals’ lived experiences and own voices.\n            In addition, I examine what social and cultural environments\n            communicate during transitions using ecologically grounded\n            methods.
