I take a social ecological approach, grounding people in their local environments, to address this critical issue for human flourishing.\nI ground my research in intersectionality theory. Life transitions tend to be harder for those belonging to oppressed social identities. Differences in societal messaging driven by systemic bias may make navigating transitional experiences more distressing, contributing to greater inequity in health and well-being. Societal messaging (e.g., from literature, television, social media) and individual reactions (e.g., attributions, internalizing) can either ameliorate or compound feelings of uncertainty or anxiety during life transitions.\nFeel free to email me if there is any project listed here that you would like to know more about.\nPeer-Reviewed Publications\nRecent Publications\nPorcelli, S., Koch, M.
